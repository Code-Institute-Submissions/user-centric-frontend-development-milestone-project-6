# Get Funky with the Monkees - User Centric Front end Development Milestone Project One. 

### Why?

This project is my first solo worked assignment for Code Institute as I work my way through their year-long Fullstack Web Developer course. 
The goal of this project is to develop a user-centric website based on the idea of selling the well-known band "The Monkees" and providing a platform where they can be booked for live shows. 

### How? 

I have utilized 2 languages and one framework in order to complete this project. The languages used are HTML5 and CSS3 whiles the framework used is Bootstrap 4.

### UX

With booking the band being the specific goal of getting the end user to book to the band, I made sure to include anything that I taught would showcase the band in a pretty straight forward manner so as the keep the pages from including too much information and bombarding the user with useless information. Due to this site being specifically about booking the band, I felt that there were no specific age groupings or target audience as the band has enjoyed continued popularity for the past 50 years by audiences of all ages.
My UX was designed with the idea of directing the user to the bookings page. When the page is opened on larger displays, there is a jumbotron open with an attention-grabbing picture that has a "book us" button directly beneath. The same button is also located in the navbar and footer on every p[age so that the user is always able to get the booking screen.
The site is designed in such a way that the footer and the navbar include all of the vital navigation links and are easy to find for the end user. 
On large displays, the web page displays a jumbotron, a navigation menu on the top for getting to the different pages of the website and a footer with links to merchandise, another to the booking page and then links to the band's different social media accounts.
These are designed so that the jumbotron itself disappears to just leave the media on the page, the picture-anchors in the footer disappear so that just the anchor sentences remain and my navigation options also collapse into a dropdown menu so that it will save the site from looking cluttered.


### User Stories

"I have been a fan of the band since their inception in the '60s, I want to be able to use the site easily as I'm not too familiar or skilled with using computers"

"As a student, I am used to using the internet to locate what I need but I don't know much about the actual band. Id like to know before making a final decision on who I'm going to hire for my party" 

"As the client, I want to page to be as laid out as straightforward as possible so that the time it takes to develop the site doesn't run at too high a cost but also serves its purpose of getting our brand out to potential customers"

## Features

1. The Navbar

2. The jumbotron 

3. music.html

4. bookings.html:

5. The Footer 

##### 1. Navbar

The navbar is one of the main features in this project s it is the first thing that the user sees upon opening the page. The navbar contains the links to all four page. The home button is built into the logo with an anchor on the left-hand side of the
navbar as is tradition and all over the other options are pinned left styled inlined. Each nav option is highlighted in its own box in order to make a clear distinction between each of the options. The navbar also collapses to toggle menu on screen sizes smaller than 768px.

##### 2. The Jumbotron
The jumbotron is designed with the idea of directing the user directly to the bookings page. It contains a catching picture of the band and a book now option in a yellow box that contrasts the background picture that it stays within. The jumbotron also disappears from the screen on resolutions smaller than 768px.
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

##### 3. Music.html

Music.html was originally designed to be videos.html but as I was creating this section I figured that the better use of time would be to change this to feature the band's music rather than a collection of videos. I felt that this better served the purpose of selling the band for gigs rather than showcasing the videos of the band which wouldn't be relevant. I decided to add a single music video on the homepage instead. The music.html page follows the exact same layout that would have been created for the videos but instead it includes embedded spotify links. 

##### 4. Bookings.html

Bookings.html is the section in which the user can actually book the band. There is a form on this page that allows the user to fill out a form that asks for the users email address, asks the size of the audience so the band will know how much gear they will require for the gig and finally a text field that allows the user to explain what it is that they are looking for extra information.

##### 5. The Footer

The footer was designed with the band's other webpages in mind. It contains links to the Warner merch store for band memorabilia and the likes, another link to the booking page and then the band's social media links are locatde on the right with the corresponding branded icons. The pictures used for both the merch link and the bookings link also disapear on resolutions less thab 768px.


## In the Future

In the near future, I plan to add a few more features to the project but due to time constraints, the project will be uploaded as is. Extra features that I would like to add are collapsable buttons to the Spotify albums and some general streamlining to the page.

### Javasricpt components
This project uses Bootsraps built-in Javascript components to simplify DOM manipulation.

### Testing

For testing this project I have... 

1. Tried the multiple navigation items in both the navbar and the footer to make sure all links lead to where they need to send the user and that all target="_blank" opens the links on a new tab.
2. I have tested the screen on many different resolutions to make sure that the screen layout remains tidy and doesn't overlap. With these tests I am confident that the page will keep its integrity on all screen sizes larger than 150px and items remain centered.
3. The form located on bookings.html also works and shows an error when the user doesnt enter their email address correctly. 


### Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE and deployed to the online repository GitHub. 



### Credits
Many of the ideas for code, media, and layout have been inspired from many different sources over the internet. Over the course of this project, I have drawn inspiration and required assistance with troubleshooting my own mistakes from sources online where developers had already highlighted and resolved the issues.
